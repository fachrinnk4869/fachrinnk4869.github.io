Fachri is an undergraduate Computer Science student at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. His current research focuses on developing an end-to-end autonomous vehicle system using transformer-based architectures. By integrating perception and control in a unified deep learning pipeline, he evaluates system performance through the CARLA simulation platform. His work bridges modern computer vision with real-world autonomous driving challenges, aiming to push the boundaries of intelligent transportation systems.
